THis is a chatGPT-generated verilog code for a single-channel and a four-channel PWM generator using the following prompts:

1)you are the best verilog coder in the world. Provide the complete code for a complete PWM module
2)when counter is not less than duty cycle it will be always 0 
3)The first version is better. Just the counter need to keep running always 
4)I need four PWM channels in total. Please update the code accordingly

The code is simple but shows the capability (and limits) of chatGPT 3.5 as a generator of RTL code.
